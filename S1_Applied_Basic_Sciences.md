### Q1.1
A 21-year-old footballer presents to A&E with a _stabbing pain_ above his right _knee joint_. He states the pain _came on suddenly_ while he was sprinting. On examination, he is _unable to extend the leg_ and he _walks with a limp_. There is _suprapatellar swelling_ and an _absent knee jerk_.
