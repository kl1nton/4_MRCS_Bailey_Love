Questions 1.1-1.10
------------------

??% - F: ?

### Q1
A 21-year-old footballer presents to A&E with a _stabbing pain_ above his right _knee joint_. He states the pain _came on suddenly_ while he was sprinting. On examination, he is _unable to extend the leg_ and he _walks with a limp_. There is _suprapatellar swelling_ and an _absent knee jerk_. What is the likely diagnosis?
    
    A. Fracture of patella
    B. Injury to posterior cruciate ligament (PCA)
    C. Tear of adductor magnus muscle
    D. Tear of biceps femoris muscle
    E. Tear of quadriceps tendon
    
#### Answer: E. Tear of quadriceps tendon - TRUE
- A 21-year-old male has sustained an injury of sudden onset, associated with:
	1. Swelling
	2. Inability to extend at the knee joint; and 
	3. Absent knee reflex
- Consistent with an injury to the quadriceps group of muscles
	- Lie in the anterior compartment of the thigh
	- Act as the principal extensors of the knee joint
	
**Notes**
- The mechanism of injury is _inconsistent_ with a fractured patella

### Q2
During strenuous exercise, what else occurs besides tachycardia?

    A. Rise in PaCO2
    B. Increase stroke volume (SV)
    C. Rise in mixed venous blood O2 saturation
    D. No change to blood pressure
    E. Increased renal blood flow

#### Answer: A. Rise in PaCO2 - *FALSE* = B. Increase stroke volume (SV) - TRUE

- During _strenuous exercise_ there is an increase in 
	1. Heart Rate (HR)
	2. Stroke Volume (SV)
	3. Cardiac Output (CO = HR x SV)
- During exercise
	- Increase in respiratory rate (_hyperventilation_) 
		- Reduced PaCO2
	- Oxygen demand of skeletal muscle rises
		- Reduced mixed venous blood oxygen concentration
	- Renal blood flow is **autoregulated**
		- So renal blood flow is preserved and will tend to remain constant

##### Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MABP)
- MABP is a function of 
	1. Cardiac Output (CO)
	2. Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR)
- MABP will increase with exercise
	- Mainly due to increase in Cardiac Output (CO)

**Notes**
- Cardiac output (CO) is a function of heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV) 

### Q3
A patient is found to have *thrombophlebitis migrans*. What other condition must be considered?

    A. Venous insufficiency
    B. Diabetes mellitus (DM)
    C. Bronchial carcinoma
    D. Lyme disease
    E. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome

#### Answer: E. Beckwith-Wiedeman Syndrome - *FALSE* = C. Bronchial carcinoma = TRUE

- _Thrombophlebitis migrans_ (or migratory thrombophlebitis) is a condition that results in 
	- Recurrent episodes of venous inflammation (_phlebitis_) associated with _thrombosis_
	- That occurs in different locations (_migratory_)

- Generally caused by inflammatory, or malignant, conditions 
	- Where the patient is tipped into a hypercoagulable state

- When associated with _malignant conditions_ it is known as **Trousseau’s syndrome** 
	- Is generally associated with visceral malignancies (adenocarcinomas), such as
		1. Gastric carcinoma
		2. Pancreatic carcinoma
		3. Bronchial carcinoma

**Notes**
- Thrombophlebitis migrans is a non-metastatic (or _paraneoplastic_) effect of malignancy
	- It is related to factors secreted by tumours

### Q4
A 42-yo lady is involved in a road traffic acident (RTA). She presents with dislocated shoulder. The shoulder is relocated by you in A&E but afterwards you notice winging of the scapula.

Which nerve or muscle is likely to be damaged?

    A. Axillary nerve
    B. Teres major
    C. Radial nerve
    D. Long thoracic nerve of Bell
    E. Deltoid

#### Answer: D. Long thoracic nerve of Bell - TRUE
- Serratus anterior acts to protract upper limb at shoulder joint (the ‘boxing’ muscle)
- It is innervated by the **long thoracic nerve of Bell** 
	- A branch of the *brachial plexus*, it has root values C5, 6 and 7
	- This may be remembered by the old aphorism "C5, 6, 7 – Bells of Heaven"
- A problem with either the nerve or muscle leads
	- Loss of the normal function of the muscle
	- *Winging of Scapula* when patient is asked to push against a wall
	
**Notes**	
- This is an important clinical sign
	- Nerve Injury: following axillary lymph node clearance for breast cancer
	- Muscle Injury: some forms of muscular dystrophy

### Q5
Which cells cannot regenerate?

    A. Peripheral nerve cells
    B. Schwann cells
    C. Renal tubular cells
    D. Mucosal cells
    E. Liver cells

#### Answer: C. Renal tubular cells - TRUE 

##### Renal Tubular Cells
- Lack the ability to regenerate following injury
	- This is why renal blood flow is so carefully autoregulated
	- It is also why acute tubular necrosis is taken so seriously
	
- Damage to renal tubular cells is **irreversible**
	- Will lead to end-stage renal failure
	- Requiring renal replacement therapy: either dialysis or transplantation

##### Peripheral Nerve Cells
- Unlike nerve cells of CNS, they **do** regenerate following injury
	- It is a slow process that occurs at about 1 mm/day
	- May be followed with nerve conduction studies

##### Schwann Cells
- Responsible for myelination of nerve fibres: increases axonal speed of conduction
	- Following injury (_Wallerian degeneration_), they are able to regenerate 

##### Mucosal cells
- Epithelial cells which behave like stem cells
	- Can therefore continuously renew themselves

##### Liver Cells 
- Under certain circumstances (hepatocytes) can be stimulated to divide. 

### Q6
Which of the following is a feature of metastatic spread?

    A. Commonly occurs transluminally
    B. Basal cell carcinomas (BCC) commonly spread via lymphatics
    C. Osteosarcomas commonly spread via lymphatics
    D. Prostatic Carcinoma commonly spreads via the blood
    E. Spread follows the pattern of venous drainage

#### Answer: D. Prostatic carcinoma commonly spreads via the blood - **TRUE**
- Metastasis may be defined as 
	- Survival and growth of cells that have migrated or have otherwise been transferred 
	- From a malignant tumour to a site or sites distant from the primary

- Tumours commonly spread via the lymphatic and haematogenous routes
	- spread generally follows the pattern of these two routes
- Other routes are less common: transcoelomic, perineural, CSF, iatrogenic
- Although there are some exceptions, as a general rule
	- Adenocarcinomas spread via lymphatics
	- Sarcomas typically spread haematogenously
		- So osteosarcomas typically spread via bloodstream
- Basal cell carcinomas rarely metastasize (thereby excluding answer B) 
	- But tend to cause destruction through local invasion
- Prostate Adenocarcinoma metastasize via basivertebral vertebral venous plexus to bone

### Q7
A 35-year-old man is knocked off his bicycle and hits his head on the kerb
PC: brought to hospital with a fluctuating score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
Ix: he underwent a CT-Head scan which shows a biconvex-shaped haematoma
Q : which other finding is he most likely to have?

    A. Midline shift
    B. Subdural haemorrhage
    C. Skull fracture
    D. Subarachnoid haemorrhage
    E. Papilloedema

#### Answer: A. Midline shift - **FALSE** = C. Skull fracture
- Biconvex-shaped haematoma on Head-CT scan is consistent with Extradural Haematoma (fluctuating GCS score)
	- Crescenteric-shaped haematoma is caused by a Subdural Haematoma
- Extradural haematomas are caused by arterial SBA bleeds 
	- typically by Middle Meningeal Artery (MMA)
	- branch of maxillary artery (via Foramen Spinosum)
- Usually the artery is torn during a traumatic episode around Pterion 
	- which is the weakest part of the skull
- Middle meningeal artery forms a close relation to Pterion of the Skull
- Management is resuscitation with immediate evacuation through burr holes to prevent a deterioration in neurological function

**Note**
- Fracture at Pterion leads to a torn MMA and Extradural Haematoma

### Q8
In wound healing, which cells are responsible for wound contraction?

    A. Fibroblasts
    B. Macrophages
    C. Reticulocytes
    D. Giant cells
    E. Lymphocytes

#### Answer: A. Fibroblasts - **TRUE**

##### Stages of Wound Healing
1. haemostasis/coagulation
2. acute inflammation
3. formation of granulation tissue (endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages)
4. angiogenesis
5. epithelialization, fibroplasia, wound contraction (myofibroblasts)
6. remodelling

**Notes**
- During wound contraction phase (which is responsible for forming a *mature scar*)
	- Fibroblasts change phenotypes and take on contractile properties (forming *myofibroblasts*)
	- They are primarily responsible for drawing the two wound edges together
- Macrophages are responsible for engulfing foreign and particulate matter through phagocytosis
	- also release cytokines that assist in inflammatory and healing phases of injury response
- Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells (erythrocytes) and play no significant role in wound contraction
- Giant cells are formed from a coalescence of macrophages and are seen in granulomatous conditions 
	- but again play no significant role in wound contraction.

### Q9 - TODO
Which is a feature of _adenoma_?

    A. Typically encapsulated
    B. Can arise in transitional cells
    C. Typically invades the basement membrane
    D. Typically annular lesions
    E. Does not contain dysplastic cells

#### Answer: E. Does not contain dysplastic cells - *FALSE* = A. Typically encapsulated
- An adenoma is defined as a benign tumour of epithelial cells. Table 1 distinguishes the main

features of benign and malignant tumours.

Benign tumours do not spread beyond the basement membrane, nor metastasize to distant sites.

They are typically encapsulated and have a pseudocapsule caused by compression of the normal

surrounding tissues as a result of their slow growth.

﻿SCIENCES

Some cells may be dysplastic within a benign tumour (dysplasia means ‘precancerous’, or

disordered, cells but importantly without the ability to invade through the basement membrane

﻿BASIC

and metastasize to distant sites, so technically by definition are still benign). Dysplasia represents an important step in the progression to a malignant tumour and severe dysplasia is synonymous

with carcinoma-in-situ. Examples of adenomas that may contain dysplastic cells include some types APPLIED

of bowel polyps (e.g. tubular, villous and tubulovillous polyps/adenomas).

Most adenomas are solid nodules, rather than being annular or circumferential lesions. Rectal

carcinomas (that are malignant) can form annular or circumferential lesions.


### Q10
A singer complains of not being able to sing high notes following her thyroidectomy. What is the likely cause?

    A. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve
    B. Damage to the external laryngeal nerve
    C. Damage to the vagus nerve
    D. Tracheal stenosis
    E. Vocal cord hemiparalysis

#### Answer: C. Damage to the Vagus Nerve - *FALSE* = B. Damage to the external laryngeal nerve 
- Two important nerves are at risk in a thyroidectomy.
	1. Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve 
		- Supplies all intrinsic muscles of the larynx with exception of cricothyroid muscle
		- Damage on either side leads to vocal fold paralysis and resulting hoarseness
		- Bilateral injury leads to stridor 
			- may necessitate a tracheostomy to maintain a reasonable airway (Semon’s law)
	2. External Branch of Superior Laryngeal Nerve 
		- Supplies Cricothyroid 
		- Responsible for lengthening and shortening of vocal cords (controlling voice pitch)
